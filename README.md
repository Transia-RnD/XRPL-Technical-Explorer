# XRP Ledger Technical Explorer [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c16a50c4-d71f-4c20-be25-93f993497873/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/xrpl-technical-explorer/deploys)

A technical (geeky) JSON viewing explorer for the XRP Ledger.

## BETA!
Early beta of a new (technical) tx / ledger / object / hash explorer I'm working on, for XRPLF.

- Mainnet: https://explorer.xrplf.org
- Testnet: https://explorer-testnet.xrplf.org
- Xahau Mainnet: https://explorer.xahau.network
- Xahau Testnet: https://explorer.xahau-test.net

It's easy to roll your own as the wss endpoint is an env. var.

## Custom nodes

You can connect to a custom node by appending a websocket location without the two slashes after the protocol to the URL, e.g.:
`https://explorer.my-domain.com/wss:xahau-test.net:444/`

Lots to do, but the beginning is here. You can view (JSON, technical (!) explorer) ledgers, transactions, meta, etc. and click through, on ledger numbers, hashes, transaction hashes, accounts, etc.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

Configure alternative WebSocket endpoint with the env. variable:
```
PORT
VUE_APP_WSS_ENDPOINT
```

E.g. ```
PORT=4000
VUE_APP_WSS_ENDPOINT=wss://hooks-testnet-v3.xrpl-labs.com
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
